Title:
Readme-Generator

Description:
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app. What is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of a project README to get started quickly. This will allow a project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

Installation:
At first, you need to have node.js downloaded on the machine. Then you need to install the required modules: 'npm install inquirer'

Usage:
The user need to open the command line and type 'node index.js' and complete each sections: project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. When the user enters the GitHub username and email, these are added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile. When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README.

Contributing:
Please contribute to this project following this guideline: [CONTRIBUTOR COVENANT CODE OF CONDUCT](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/).
