## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, it is important to have a quality README with information about the app. What is the app for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions so, other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project. A command-line application allows quick and easy generation of a project README to get started. This allows the project creator to spend more time working on finishing the project and less time creating a good README.

## Installation
At first, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then you need to install the required modules by running `npm install` in the command-line.

## Usage
The user need to open the command-line, type `node index.js`, and enter input for each section: project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, license, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and contact information. When the user enters their GitHub username and email, these are added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to the GitHub profile. When the user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents the user is taken to the corresponding section of the README.
